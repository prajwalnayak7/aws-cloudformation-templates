# AWS CloudFormation Templates

Welcome to the repository of AWS CloudFormation templates curated by Prajwal Nayak. This repository contains a collection of CloudFormation templates designed to provision and manage AWS resources efficiently and in a best practices manner.

## Overview

AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This file serves as the single source of truth for your cloud environment.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into multiple directories, each representing a specific AWS service or a solution pattern. Here's a brief overview of the current structure:
- `auth/` - Templates for IAM, Cognito, etc 
- `compute/` - Templates for EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, Step Function, etc
- `network/` - Templates for VPC and related component setup
- `storage/` - Templates for DDB, S3, RDS, Redis, etc
- `misc/` - Everything else

## Usage

To use these templates:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/prajwalnayak7/aws-cloudformation-templates.git`
